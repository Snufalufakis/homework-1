## Overview

### The challenge

While keeping the same look and feel of the page. Reduce the ammount of code needed.

### User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called **scenario-oriented criteria** which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of Challenges.
